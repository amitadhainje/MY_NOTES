1. AI can be categorized into two sections - Generative AI and Non-Generative AI
    1. Generative AI - New Content ( Text, images, videos and audio ) will be generated using ML models. 
    2. Non-Generative AI - Classification and Regression ML models
2. Language Model is an AI model that can oredict the next word ( or set of words) for a given sequence of words. When a huge amount of data is fed to a language model, like loads of news, books etc, it becomes a Large Language Model.
3. GPT = Generative Pre-trained Transformers
4. Text to text models = BERT (Google), GPT (OpenAI)
5. Text to Image models = DALL-E and Stable Difusion
6. Text to video - OpenAI Sora
7. Critical breakthrough in GenAI came with the research paper = "Attention is all you need" which introduced a special neural network model named "Transformers".
8. Statistical ML ==> Neural Networks ==> RNN ==> Transformers
