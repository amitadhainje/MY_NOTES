# NEO4J

1. Neo4j is one of the most popular graph database. 
2. Graphs represents the entities as nodes and the ways in which those entities relate to the world as relationships. 
3. A Neo4j graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it. 
4. Neo4j is a native graph database, which means that it implements a true graph model all the way down to the storage level. The data is stored as you whiteboard it, instead of as a "graph abstraction" on top of another technology. Beyond the core graph, Neo4j also provides: ACID transactions, cluster support, and runtime failover.
5. Many databases fall short in handling complex connections between your data.
